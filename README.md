# Medibox

Development of a ”Medibox,” a smart IoT device that is designed to help users manage their medications effectively.

In this project, we created a Medibox prototype using node-RED for dashboard design and ESP32 as the controller, with the Wokwi platform serving as the implementation platform. This included event alerting via buzzer, medication scheduling, environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, light intensity), and avoiding excessive light penetration through a shaded sliding window. It also has a settings tab for customizing the device.
